Aside from this, a VPN also offers more control over who can access your data, since there is no way for anyone to trace it back to you.</p><p>Lastly, you need a reliable VPN, such as ExpressVPN, for Android TV Box. This is because ExpressVPN offers fast speeds for streaming and has proven itself as one of the most reliable VPN services.
