A2 : There are several free VPNs available for Android on the Google Play Store. However, it&rsquo;s important to be aware that not all free VPNs are safe to use. To download a reliable free VPN for Android, users should look for VPNs with good reviews and a reliable security protocol, such as OpenVPN.</p><p>Q3 : How do I know if a free VPN is secure?
