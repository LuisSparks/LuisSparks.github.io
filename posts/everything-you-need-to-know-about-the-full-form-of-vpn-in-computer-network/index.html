By using a VPN, businesses and users can ensure that their data is safe and secure, without having to worry about exposing it to the public.</p><h3 id=a-security>A. Security<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#a-security>#</a></h3><p>A virtual private network, or VPN, is a secure connection between two or more devices across a public network such as the internet. VPNs are used to protect both private and public network traffic from one point to another. VPNs provide a secure channel for remote access to a corporate network and can be used to encrypt traffic or hide a user’s IP address. VPNs are particularly useful for organizations working in complex, multi-site environments where there is a need for secure communication between remote users.</p><p>One of the primary benefits of using a VPN is that it allows users to access corporate resources or files securely over a public network. This means that employees can access corporate networks from anywhere without having to worry about security risks. Additionally, VPNs can be used to bypass regional restrictions and censorship, allowing users to access websites and services that may be blocked in their country.</p><p>Furthermore, VPNs can be used to mask a user’s IP address and to encrypt data transmitted over public networks, ensuring that data is not visible to malicious attackers. This also means that the data that is sent over the network remains private, which can have important implications for businesses or organizations that need to protect sensitive data.</p><p>Lastly, using a VPN can help organizations save money by reducing the need for leased lines. By utilizing a VPN, employees can access corporate networks from any location, reducing the need for expensive leased lines. This provides organizations with an added benefit of cost savings, allowing them to better allocate resources.</p><h3 id=b-cost-efficiency>B.

How to setup a VPN in computer network<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#3-how-to-setup-a-vpn-in-computer-network>#</a></h2><p>VPN stands for Virtual Private Network and is an essential part of any computer network. It helps to provide a secure connection to the internet and protect the data and privacy of the users. Setting up a VPN in a computer network is quite easy and straightforward. First, a VPN gateway is needed to create a secure tunnel between the user and the network. Then, a VPN client is installed in every computer in the network to connect them securely to the gateway. Finally, setting up a username and password for secure access to the network is the last step. With these steps, a secure and reliable VPN network is created for the users to access the internet safely.</p><h3 id=i-understanding-the-basics-of-vpn>I. Understanding the Basics of VPN<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#i-understanding-the-basics-of-vpn>#</a></h3><p>A VPN, or a Virtual Private Network, is a secure, encrypted connection that uses the internet to connect remote devices or networks together. It is often used to protect a computer network from unauthorized access and viruses. Setting up a VPN for a computer network is a relatively straightforward process that requires only a few steps. First, the security parameters must be established to ensure that the connection is secure and trusted. This involves setting the encryption protocols, authorization methods, and IP addresses that will be allowed to access the network. Once these parameters are set, the next step is establishing the actual connection. This involves configuring the router so that the VPN traffic is directed to the correct destination. Finally, the network will need to be configured to allow the connection to be established and used. With these steps, a computer network can be securely connected with a VPN in no time.</p><h3 id=ii-setting-up-a-vpn-in-computer-network>II. Setting Up a VPN in Computer Network<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#ii-setting-up-a-vpn-in-computer-network>#</a></h3><p>A virtual private network (VPN) is a secure private network connection established over a public network such as the Internet. A VPN provides a secure path from a remote user&rsquo;s computer to an internal network or private network. It encrypts data transmitted between the two networks, allowing for secure transfer of data over a public network. Setting up a VPN in a computer network is relatively easy, the most important thing is to have the right hardware and software.</p><p>In order to setup a VPN, users will need to install a VPN client on their computers. This client will enable users to establish a secure connection with a VPN server. The server will then act as a gateway between the user&rsquo;s computer and the desired network. Once setup and configured, users will be able to connect to the VPN server and access the internal network.</p><p>Another important component when setting up a VPN in computer network is the configuration of network security protocols. These protocols help to ensure that data travels securely through the network and provides additional security features such as authentication and encryption. This ensures that unauthorized users cannot access the network.</p><p>Last but not least, users will need to set up rules on their firewall. Firewalls are used to protect the internal network from malicious attacks. They can be configured to allow certain types of traffic such as VPN traffic and to deny all other traffic. This allows users to have an extra layer of protection when accessing the internal network. With the right hardware and software, a VPN can be easily setup and configured with a few simple steps.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/_wQTRMBAvzg style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>Q1: What is the full form of VPN?
