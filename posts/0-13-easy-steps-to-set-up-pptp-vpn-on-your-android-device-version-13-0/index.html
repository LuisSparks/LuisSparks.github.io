Once it’s installed, open the app and accept the user agreement. Then enter the credentials provided by your VPN provider and click the sign-in button. You should now be connected to the VPN server.\nNext, you’ll need to configure the VPN to your desired settings. Go to the settings section of the app and scroll down to the VPN section.

It’s easy to set up and works on all devices and operating systems.\nQ2: How do I set up PPTP VPN on my Android device? A2: Setting up PPTP VPN on an Android device is easy and straightforward. The following are the steps you need to follow:\nOpen the VPN settings in your device. Select ‘Add VPN’ and choose ‘PPTP’ from the list of options. Enter the server address and username into the respective fields. Select the ‘PPP encryption (MPPE)’ option.
